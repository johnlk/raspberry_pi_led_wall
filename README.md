# LED Light Wall
What originally was an idea for sending messages to people driving behind me, this project currently has the goal to display messages from friends on my wall, at least until further notice.

I'm hoping to have a webpage where a user can select a display color and a message to send. Once sent, it should display on my wall at home. 

Once completed, I will create a video demo and release the link to such a webpage or endpoint.
